Azure Backup & Recovery Service
=====================================
In a production env if u intend to use  virtual machine in a production purpose or some important purpose .

Different ways o take backup
 method-1:
  while creating vm and enable the backup
  VM creation -->under management menu --> enable Backup 

methos-2:
  if vm is already created then  click on
 backup & disaster recovery --> create recovery service Vault 
  recovery service vault holds backup copies and you can monitor backup vaults , backup vault is a special type of storage account that contains  virtual hard disk either we can create a new backup vault or u can use existing vault ,here we can also Choose backup policy as per our need .

methos-3:
  Instead of taking backup for 1 machines, we can also take multiple machines as well as for entire organisation or entire region as well as 

create Recovery Services Vault(service in azure) by providing details of vault name, subscription  Region, 
 backup storage redundency -  geo-redundent(preferrd for production)
                              locally-redundant--lab environment to save cost 
                              zone--redundant 

networking :
        Connectivity method :  Allow public access from all networks
                                Deny public access and allow private access ( prefered for production environment)
after creation of RECOVERY SERVICE VAULT  ->open --> 
   Where is your workload running?  : it may be azure,On-premisis
   What do you want to backup?:  VMs, Azure fileshares, AZURE SKUaL DB.

create backup policy: 
  u can define v=backup policy as hourly ,daily,weely, timings, scheduled for how many hours, Timezone 

after that we have to enable backup 


In the production environment, our first step is to create a recovery service vault in the same region as the VMs. Next, we carefully plan the backup schedule, considering input from the relevant teams and assessing the criticality of the data. Finally, we add the VMs to the backup process.  As a azure system admin , it is our duty to monitor the  backup on daily basis and act on the failure if any

In production any issues will come right so before itself they will take checklist and preactivities like websites folder backup ,dbs and automation backups.
code and wesitex backup will take readyly 

Under vms website backups and sl lo dbs backup, mostly every month they will follow this process, its onetime thing
